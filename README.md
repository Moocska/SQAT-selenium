# SQAT-selenium
Third homework for SQAT practice. Selenium tests.

Choosen website: https://www.zooplus.hu/

# Submitted for grade 3

Points for grade 4 - 1 week late


# Ban

Multiple accounts and even my IP got banned.
Maybe it is needed to register a new account (change the data in the configuration test), and change IP address to rerun all the tests.

# Remark

I selected a Hungarian website, where multiple special characters áéÁÉ etc was used in the texts, multiple times. (The given ubuntu didnt even allowed to type Á, even after changing keyboard layout from the terminal.)
Some tests did not liked these special characters, so most of the times I did a "contains" search / check for values, not "equal" search.
